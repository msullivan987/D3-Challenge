# Demographics Charting in D3

This project uses javascript and D3 to chart various demographic information in the US against the percentage of population who smoke.

Each bubble on the chart represents one of the fifty US states.

The x-axis is interactive and allows the user to toggle between median income, % of population without healthcare, and median age.

The visualization is hosted on GitHub pages:
